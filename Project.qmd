## Suggested Project Scope

Students will select a **real or hypothetical Taiwan-based business** (e.g., bubble tea chain, e-commerce startup, manufacturing SME, retail franchise) and use prompt engineering techniques to solve a specific business challenge in ONE of these areas:

1. **Marketing**: Customer segmentation and campaign development
2. **Operations**: Supply chain optimization or inventory management
3. **Financial Analysis**: Performance analysis and forecasting
4. **HR**: Competency framework or employee engagement strategy

---

## Detailed Steps to Formulate Report Topic

### Step 1: Choose Your Business Context (Week 1)

**What to do:**

- Select a specific Taiwan-based company or industry (real or fictional)
- Examples: "85�C Bakery," "TSMC supplier," "Shopee seller," "traditional tea shop expanding online"

**Criteria for selection:**

- Accessible information (public data, case studies, or reasonable assumptions)
- Clear business challenges
- Relevant to Taiwan's economic context

**Document in your report:**

- Company background (1 paragraph)
- Industry context in Taiwan
- Why you chose this business

---

### Step 2: Identify a Specific Business Problem (Week 1)

**What to do:**

- Narrow down to ONE functional area from the course modules:
  - Marketing challenge (e.g., "How to attract Gen Z customers?")
  - Operations issue (e.g., "High inventory costs during off-peak seasons")
  - Financial concern (e.g., "Declining profit margins")
  - HR need (e.g., "Hiring criteria for store managers")

**Formulation technique:**

- State the problem as a question: "How can [Company] improve [specific metric] by addressing [specific challenge]?"
- Example: "How can a Taichung bubble tea chain reduce customer acquisition costs while expanding its loyalty program?"

**Document in your report:**

- Problem statement (2-3 sentences)
- Business impact (why this matters)
- Current challenges or gaps

---

### Step 3: Define Your Prompt Engineering Approach (Week 2)

**What to do:**

- Determine which prompt techniques from the course you'll apply:
  - **Clarity & Specificity** (Week 3): For precise analysis
  - **Chain-of-Thought** (Week 4): For complex reasoning
  - **Data-Aware Prompting** (Week 6): For quantitative insights
  - **Templates** (Week 5): For structured outputs

**Create 3-5 core prompts** that you'll use throughout the project

**Example approach:**

- Prompt 1: Customer segmentation using personas template
- Prompt 2: Competitive analysis with step-by-step reasoning
- Prompt 3: Marketing campaign brief with data-driven insights

**Document in your report:**

- List of core prompts (with rationale for each)
- Expected outputs from each prompt
- How prompts connect to solve your business problem

---

### Step 4: Gather and Structure Your Data/Context (Week 2-3)

**What to do:**

- Collect relevant information:
  - Financial data (revenue, costs, margins)
  - Customer data (demographics, behavior, feedback)
  - Operational data (inventory, lead times, capacity)
  - Market data (competitors, trends, regulations)

**Organize for prompting:**

- Create simple tables or bullet lists
- Prepare context paragraphs
- Format data for insertion into prompts

**Example:**

```
Monthly Revenue Data (2024):
- Q1: NT$2.5M
- Q2: NT$2.8M
- Q3: NT$2.3M
- Q4: NT$3.1M
```

**Document in your report:**

- Data sources (even if hypothetical, state assumptions)
- How you structured data for LLM input
- Any limitations in data availability

---

### Step 5: Execute Iterative Prompt Testing (Week 3-4)

**What to do:**

- Run your initial prompts in ChatGPT
- Evaluate outputs using these criteria:
  - **Relevance**: Does it address your business problem?
  - **Specificity**: Is it detailed enough to act on?
  - **Accuracy**: Does it make logical sense?
  - **Completeness**: Does it cover all necessary aspects?

**Iteration process:**

1. Run baseline prompt � Document output
2. Identify weaknesses
3. Refine prompt (add context, examples, constraints)
4. Run revised prompt � Compare outputs
5. Repeat 2-3 times per core prompt

**Document in your report:**

- **Iteration Log Table** showing:
  - Version number
  - Prompt text
  - Key changes made
  - Output quality rating
  - Lessons learned

---

### Step 6: Analyze and Synthesize LLM Outputs (Week 4-5)

**What to do:**

- Extract actionable insights from your best prompt outputs
- Organize findings by business function:
  - **Marketing**: Segments, campaign ideas, messaging
  - **Operations**: Efficiency improvements, cost savings
  - **Financial**: Forecasts, ratio analysis, recommendations
  - **HR**: Frameworks, job descriptions, training needs

**Apply business judgment:**

- Validate LLM suggestions against real-world constraints
- Identify any hallucinations or unrealistic recommendations
- Cross-reference with course materials or industry best practices

**Document in your report:**

- Summary of key findings (1-2 pages)
- Business recommendations (prioritized list)
- Critical evaluation of LLM output quality

---

### Step 7: Address Ethics and Limitations (Week 5)

**What to do:**

- Reflect on potential issues:
  - **Bias**: Did prompts produce biased customer segments or hiring criteria?
  - **Privacy**: What data should NOT be shared with LLMs?
  - **Accuracy**: Where did the model hallucinate or make errors?
  - **Transparency**: Should stakeholders know AI was used?

**Propose guardrails:**

- Prompt modifications to reduce bias
- Human oversight checkpoints
- Validation procedures

**Document in your report:**

- Ethical considerations (1/2 page)
- Limitations of your approach
- Recommended safeguards

---

### Step 8: Create Business Recommendations (Week 6)

**What to do:**

- Translate LLM insights into concrete action items:
  - **Short-term** (implement in 1-3 months)
  - **Medium-term** (3-6 months)
  - **Long-term** (6-12 months)

**Structure recommendations:**

- What to do
- Why (business rationale)
- How (implementation steps)
- Expected impact (qualitative or quantitative)

**Example:**

> **Recommendation 1**: Launch a LINE Official Account loyalty program
> **Rationale**: LLM segmentation identified 65% of customers are aged 18-35 and prefer mobile engagement
> **Implementation**: Partner with LINE, offer 10% discount for sign-ups, integrate with POS system
> **Expected Impact**: 20% increase in repeat purchase rate within 6 months

**Document in your report:**

- 3-5 prioritized recommendations (1-2 pages)
- Implementation roadmap
- Success metrics
