# Business AI Tools: Effective ChatGPT Communication

## Course Overview
Prompt engineering is crafting precise, context-rich inputs to large language models such as ChatGPT/咚咚妞 to generate useful, accurate, and relevant outputs. It is important because well-designed prompts unlock the full potential of AI, enabling businesses to automate analyses, drive insights, and enhance decision-making. By the end of this course, students will be able to explain the fundamental principles and components of prompt engineering and how large language models interpret and generate responses. They will develop the skills to design clear, specific, and context-rich prompts tailored to key business-management scenarios such as marketing, finance, operations, and human resources. Through hands-on practice and iterative refinement, students will learn to evaluate the quality of AI outputs, identify biases or errors, and implement strategies for continuous prompt optimization. They will integrate prompt-driven workflows into real-world business processes, confidently automating routine analyses and report generation. Finally, students will demonstrate responsible and ethical use of AI by recognizing potential risks, ensuring data privacy, and establishing guardrails to mitigate bias in their applications.
